/*
  Challenge: countBy
  Create a function countBy that accepts an array and a callback,
   and returns an object. countBy will iterate through the array
    and perform the callback on each element. Each return value
     from the callback will be saved as a key on the object.
      The value associated with each key will be the number of
       times that particular return value was returned.
