/*
  Challenge: For Loops - Fundamentals


  Using a for loop, decrement countDown by
  one each time the loop runs until it equals 0,
   making use of looping functionality instead of 
   logging each number separately.

let countDown = 10;
// ADD CODE HERE
for (let i = countDown; i > 0; i--) {
  countDown--
}

// Uncomment the below line to check your work
console.log(countDown) // -> should print 0s
